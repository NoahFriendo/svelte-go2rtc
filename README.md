# go2rtc Video Stream Component for Svelte

This library provides a Svelte component to display a video stream from a [go2rtc](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc) server.
The component was ported from [WebRTC Camera](https://github.com/AlexxIT/WebRTC).

## Example page

### [Source](/src/routes/+page.svelte)

### Run the demo

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run dev server
pnpm run dev
```

### [Open the page](http://localhost:5173)

The dev server might not bind to port 5173, so just use the link from the dev server output.
